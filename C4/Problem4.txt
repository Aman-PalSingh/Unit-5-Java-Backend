part b)
What is caching, explain its use cases?

it is the memory which is very nearest to the CPU, all recent information are stored into cache memory
The data in a cache is  stored  RAM (Random-access memory) and may also be used in correlation with a software component.
Caches are used everywhere in our modern devices. It's found in many hardware components and throughout software.
 The goal of caching is to store data from slow memory into fast memory so it can be retrieved quicker
Use Cases:-
1.Database Caching.
2.CDN(Content Delivery Network)
3.Web Caching.
4.RDBMS Speedup
5.Integrated Cache.
6.General Cache.
7.Token Caching

 part c)
 what are web sockets where it is used.
 ANswer===
 The WebSocket protocol enables interaction between a web browser (or other client application) and a web server
 Its allow both the server and the client to push messages at any time. Almost every borser supports Websockets
 also solve HTTP issues:-
                        )Full-duplex communication ----->  client and server can talk to each other independently(same time)
                        Bi-directional protocol:----> client/server can send a message to the other party

                       *) when connections are terminated  its can't recover automatically.we have to implement ourself


uses:

 Multiplayer games
 Multimedia Chats
 editing/coding
 Social feed
 Financial tickers

   part d)
    How are public and private keys used in encryption and decryption?
Answer:
public and private keys  both are commonly used for encryption and decryption.

It is an encryption technique that uses a pair of keys for
secure data communication.
 In the pair of keys,
  public key -----> encrypting (the plain text to convert it into ciphertext),public key is provided to the public
  private key ----->used for decrypting (the ciphertext to read the message.), it given to the receiver

All asymmetric key pairs are unique, so a message only be read by the person who has the corresponding private key
