Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

It is one of the solid principles
A child class Object can replace the object of parent class without breaking the program.
If the above condition is satisfied then then it can be called as LSV.
Loose Coupling may is achieved by LSV therefore our program becomes adaptive and flexible.
