Problem 2: 
What is the 3NF? Explain with an example. You donâ€™t need to draw the
tables or write the queries. Just mention the schema before and after the
third normal form.

Answer:-

3 NF Stands for third normal form.
 for a form to be in 3NF:-
1. It hsould be in 2NF
2. there Should be transitive dependency on super key

transitive dependancy :-
if x depends on y and y depends on z
therefor x will depend on z 
this is know as transitive dependency
  to convert table to 3 nf we need to divide the table 
Example

Table Employee

emp_id    emp_name     emp_add        emp_dept
1         Aman         Raipur           D1
2         Akash        Bilaspur         D2
3         Ashwin       Akaltara         D1
4         Apoorva      Raipur           D2


1st part


emp_id    emp_name     emp_add        
1         Aman         Raipur          
2         Akash        Bilaspur        
3         Ashwin       Akaltara         
4         Apoorva      Raipur 


2nd Part


emp_id             emp_dept
1                  D1
2                  D2
3                  D1
4                  D2


Problem 3: 
Briefly explain what a transaction is along with the ACID properties.

Answer:-

Clubbing multiple statement in SQL is known as transaction.
A database transaction my=ust follow ACID properties.
Where A Stands for Atomic
Where C Stands for Consistent.
Where I Stands for Isolated.
Where D Stands for Durable.

1. Atomic- all commands in the transaction should be completely executed or none of them thould be executed there should be no in between consiton.

2. Consistent - All data should be in consitent state like in fund transfer consistency ensures that sum of funds inboth account remains same even after 
   transfer of funds from one account to another.

3. Isolted- Modification of data performed by tansaction should be independent.

4. Durable-effect of modification performed should be permanent therefore it should be retrievable after long periods of time.



Problem 4: 
Table: Person
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+---------+
| personId | int |
| lastName | varchar |
| firstName | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
personId is the primary key column for this table.
This table contains information about the ID of some persons and their
first and last names.
Table: Address
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+---------+
| addressId | int |
| personId | int |
| city | varchar |
| state | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
addressId is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the city and state of one
person with ID = PersonId.
Write an SQL query to report the first name, last name, city, and state of
each person in the Person table. If the address of a personId is not
present in the Address table, report null instead.
Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example.
Example 1:
Input:
Person table:
+----------+----------+-----------+
| personId | lastName | firstName |
+----------+----------+-----------+
| 1 | Wang | Allen |
| 2 | Alice | Bob |
+----------+----------+-----------+
Address table:
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
| addressId | personId | city | state |
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
| 1 | 2 | New York City | New York |
| 2 | 3 | Leetcode | California |
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
Output:
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
| firstName | lastName | city | state |
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
| Allen | Wang | Null | Null |
| Bob | Alice | New York City | New York |
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
Explanation:
There is no address in the address table for the personId = 1 so we return
null in their city and state.
addressId = 1 contains information about the address of personId = 2.

Answer

create database unit5_c1;
use unit5_c1;
create table Person(personId int Primary Key,lastName varchar(13),fristName varchar(13));
decribe person;
create table Address(addressId int Primary Key,personId int,city varchar(13),state varchar(13));
describe person;
insert into person values(1,"Wang","Allen"),(2,"Alice","Bob");
select * from person;
insert into address values(1,2,"New York City","New York"),(2,3,"Leetcode","California");
select * from address;
select p.personId,p.firstName,p.lastName,a.city,a.state from person p left join  address a on p.personId = a.personId;
